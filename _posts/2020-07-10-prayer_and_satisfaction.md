### The Acronym of A.C.T.S.
<p>In the gospels of Matthew and Luke, when the disciples ask Jesus how to pray, he responds by showing them the manner in which they are to pray. This is not to say that the way you are to pray is just to always recite the words of the "Lord's Prayer", but he is illustrating to us elements that should be included in prayer. Scholars, in studying this, have broken the Lord's Prayer into 4 distinct elements: Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, and Supplication (ACTS).</p>
<p>In the name of brevity, I will not dive into a deep study of this pattern but I highly encourage you to check out this brief <a href="https://www.ligonier.org/blog/simple-acrostic-prayer/" target="_blank">Ligonier article</a> as well as this longer <a href="https://connect.ligonier.org/library/prayer/about/" target="_blank">teaching series</a> on prayer.</p>

### The Problem of Supplication
<p>It is not wrong to pray that God would answer prayers for you. In fact it is commanded in Scripture that we should indeed ask him for things (John 15:7, Philippians 4:16). However, if you note in the passages I just referenced, you'll find they are qualified by something. In John you read "if you abide in me" and in Philippians you read "by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving". There are obviously dozens of passages about prayer but I think these two specifically hit the point of the Lord's Prayer and A.C.T.S. acronym. You see, I find in the church today that Christians spend so much time asking God for things while spending little if any time giving him adoration, confessing our sins to him, and thanking him for what he's already given us. It is not wrong, as I've already stated, to ask God for things. It becomes problematic however when the majority of our time spent talking with God in prayer is used on supplication.</p>
<p>So how do we abide in God with regards to prayer or offer up supplication with thanksgiving? We pattern our prayers with something like A.C.T.S. The beauty of this acronym and method of forming our prayers is, by the time we have been in prayer adoring God for who he is, confessing our sins to him, and thanking him for the countless blessings he's already bestowed upon us, our hearts are so much more closely aligned with his that we will better understand our own supplications.</p>

### Satisfaction in Christ
<p>Time and time again, I have seen Christians in despair for supplicatory prayers that have gone unanswered. Sometimes even to the point of feeling such despair that they may be driven to think of God as cruel and unloving. Prayers for relief from things like loneliness, the longing for a spouse, the longing for a child, and the list goes on. I cannot help but wonder what their prayers for these things look like. Have they been praying for years to the Lord in supplication but neglecting the other three elements we see in the Lord's Prayer?</p>
<p>Our God is omniscient and is a masterful planner. Is it not unlikely to think that he has not granted these prayers because there is something deeper that they are truly longing for? Namely, a longing for Christ himself? I sense that, should God grant them things like a spouse, a child etc, they would perhaps be driven deeper into despair when they realize that those things will not ultimately satisfy them. For the Christian, our deepest longing and satisfaction can only come from Christ himself. I fear that desire for Christ is clouded when overtaken by earthly desires at times.</p>
<p>Saints, may we always strive to be satisfied in Christ first and foremost. May our longing for supplication always be first fulfilled in the supplier, Christ Jesus. May he be the object of our desires and his glory be the chief end for all that we ask of him. The things of this world are temporary, but the glory of God is eternal and will always outlive anything we could desire in this short time on Earth.
