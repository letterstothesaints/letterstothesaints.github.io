### Opening
<p>To the saints of Jesus Christ, foreknown, predestined, called, justified, and one day by the grace of God, glorified. I write to you on the matter of joining in recognized membership with a local Bible believing church body. We live in a time where the importance of the church in the role of our sanctification and lives is greatly diminished. A time where people would so quickly abandon a church body over a dislike of music or a conflict with a fellow believer. A time where choosing a church to attend, if someone even attends at all, is treated like a buffet where we can so easily pick and choose a church body based on a list of our own expectations and preferences and then simply abandon it when they fail to meet any of our personal criteria. This ought not be the case brother and sister. I write this appeal in prayer and hope that this simple yet serious precedent set forth in scripture of church membership would be illuminated to you. I am but a flawed man writing to flawed people. Should I err from truth over the course of this appeal, may God have mercy on me and may my brother and sister approach me in truth and love.</p>

### The Counting of the Saved
<p>I would like to begin by observing the passages of scripture where we observe instances of groups being brought into the body of the church through salvation and baptism.</p>

<blockquote>
 So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls<br>
- Acts 2:41 NASB
</blockquote>

<p>Early in Acts as the church began to grow, we see here that the Apostles were counting those who were saved. For what purpose is this documentation? Surely we can assume that it was not for any arbitrary purpose nor was it without reason at all. They were documenting those who were a part of the church there. These were not just believers who were baptized and then walked away to find somewhere else to gather and hear preaching. They were welcomed into the family of believers there. 

<blockquote>Day by day continuing with <b>one mind in the <u>temple</u></b>, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals <b>together</b> with gladness and sincerity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to <b>their</b> number day by day those who were being saved.<br>
- Acts 2:46,47 NASB
</blockquote>

Just a couple of verses down we can see the intimacy of this group described even further of being of "one mind" in the "temple". Just as they were regularly sharing meals together and meeting together in their homes, this specific group was rejoining together on the Lord's Day in the temple for corporate worship. There is a familial sense that they shared with one another. While yes, we do share this adoption as sons and daughters with all believers, these passages illuminate a specific body, counted and recognized by the rest of the believers, as being one congregation together.
</p>

### The Church Offices and Discipline
<p>Furthermore, we see a form of governance being established in the early church. Offices such as Pastor, Elder, and Deacon. To what shepherd is a sheep joined should he eat in one pasture, find grooming in another, and sleep in yet another? The charges of responsibility for those who oversee the church are serious.</p>

<blockquote>Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.<br>
- Hebrews 13:17 NASB</blockquote>

<p>In Hebrews, we are called to submit to our leaders. Specifically we see it followed by "for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account". On that glorious day when we see the Lord face to face, those who lead the churches will stand before God and have to give an account to him for how they led you. To whom has the responsibility of the man who partakes of a sermon in one place and Bible studies in another while he feeds from many pulpits? To which body of believers do the gifts the Lord has given any person to edify the body, belong? What real authority does the Pastor have, who we are called to submit to, over the person who has never fully joined in membership with that body of believers? So long as one attends a church even faithfully, without recognizing a formal membership to that body, they are but a guest among family.</p>

<p>To add emphasis, what are we to do with passages on church discipline? Church discipline is an act of grace given to the church by God to bring back and restore those in sin to the body of believers.</p>

<blockquote>“If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother.
 “But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every fact may be confirmed. “If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.<br>
- Matthew 18:15-17</blockquote>

<p>In dealing with the unrepentant sinner, Christ has laid out a clear plan of action on how to approach each other. Should a person remain unrepentant, the final step of the process is to bring them before the church. Who is the church here? Are they to consult every believer in the region and ask them to appeal to this brother or sister to repent? I would contend this passage is assuming there is an established body, who are familiar with one another and are called to approach their fellow member in truth and love to seek repentance. Should the person remain unrepentant, they are ultimately expelled from the body of believers as a "Gentile and tax collector." Surely, they did not send out a letter to all the gatherings in the region blacklisting this individual. Rather that specific body of believers recognized together that one of them has strayed.</p>

### The Grace of Accountability

<p>Though I have alluded to this earlier in this post, I would like to emphasize the grace of accountability within the local church body as a member. For those who have joined their local church body in membership, we receive the grace of God in our sanctification alongside other believers. These are just people who we see for a couple of hours once a week, but our local church family. The local church body is a place where we are to be known and to know others. It is the place where Matthew 18 works itself out, where we rejoice and cry together. How shallow is the journey of faith as a casual churchgoer week in and week out. A walk of sanctification with no pastor charged with the care for your soul. With no brothers and sisters who you join with together in worship and then walk out your faith with throughout the week. It is as if you were a foster child joined to the church family. You are loved, you are cared for, but you are not a permanent member. How joyous is it, even if painful at the moment, to be so well known that I can be approached when I stumble in sin. That my fellow believers can rejoice with me in my triumphs and mourn with me in my sorrow. This is a gift.</p>

### In Closing  

<p>Books have been written on the matter of church membership. I find this small post to be insufficient to fully examine the necessity and gift of church membership according to scripture. However I pray that it may find even one soul and lead them to be joined in membership with the body of Christ formally. Christ loves the church. He came to build the church and to save the church. Scripture even goes so far as to call the church the bride of Christ. Far be it from us to say we love Christ but refuse to publicly commit to the body of his bride. </p>
