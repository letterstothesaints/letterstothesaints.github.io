									<h4>Reclaiming a passion for scripture in an age where an increasing amount of people don't know what they believe or why they believe it</h4>
									<p>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom,<br />
                    singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever <br />
                    you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. <br />
                    ~ Colossians 3:16-17</p>

                <p>
                  In this age we are inundated with opinions and information that seem to speak to every single facet of our lives.
                From politics, to religion, to sex, and everything in between, we are overwhelmed by mountains of information at our fingertips.
              It's on your televisions, in your schools, at your workplace, in your homes, on your social media feeds, and in your pocket.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You'll find many people have strong opinions of what they believe today, but if you ask the right questions, even of Christians unfortunately,
                  their beliefs come crumbling down.
                  What do we do with all of this? How do we not only figure out what we believe, but come to a reliable conclusion on why we believe it?

								</p>
								<p>
									Scripture may not explicitly mention by name the things we see in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, but it's <a href="http://esv.to/Hebrews4:12-13" target="_blank">living and active</a> and it
                  speaks even to our lives today. In todays society that is increasingly hostile to Christians, we have to be rooted in Scripture.
                  The aim of this site is to provide engaging content that will stir that desire in you and help equip the saints of Jesus Christians
                  to not just believe, but to become defenders of the faith.
